# Frontend (dashboard)

Built with Vue and vue-charts.js.

## Setup

Before doing anything you'll need to run the dummy WebSocket server (`bun fake-ws.ts` in `demos/fake-ws`) or the real one (see the readme in `backend/relay`) and change the address in the code accordingly. Install dependencies with `bun install`, run with Vite using `npm run dev`, or bundle with `npm run build`.
