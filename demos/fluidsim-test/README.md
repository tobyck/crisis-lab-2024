This place is not a place of honor... no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here... nothing valued is here. 

We initially planned to attempt to similate the flow of water in the wave tank based on the measured heights. However, we found that we just didn't have enough information to do this accurately. We would need to know the exact shape of the tank and much more about the fluid dynamics to do this accurately.

We did attempt to do an approximate simulation, of which this folder is a failed attempt.
