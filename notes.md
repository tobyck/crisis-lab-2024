# CrisisLab 2024 Launch Day Notes

## Talk 1: Laura, PhD student, Massey, Vic, GNS

- Natural disasters will always be devastating but we can still save lives
- Earthquake data can be propagated to determine tsunami data
- NZ threat of the east coast of the north island
- Tsumanis have a series of large waves; largest is sometimes much later so "get gone and stay gone" for a while
- Small changes to earthquake position/size can greatly effect the tsunami. Topography is also a big factor.
- DART sensors: big versions of what we're doing
- Inundation: water moving onto land which was dry

## Talk 2: Dr. Grant Wilson, NEMA (nat. emergency management agency)

- NEMA is responsible for issuing warnings (they can do it the fastes)
- There's a centre which is monitoring things 24/7
- Text/email/voice messages to news, mobile alerts, social media (X is part of our national emergency management plan lol)
- Alerts also for areas in the sea where people could be swimming/sailing etc.
- Tsunamis can come from a very long way away
- Pressure sensors can detemine depth in the water
- False positives do happen, they tend not to care about them as long as they're not too common

## Talk 3: Jess and Andrea, Geoscience and Coding

- R, Matlab, Fortran??? (I don't trust these guys)
- 404 notes not found

## The Challenge

- We're given: pressure sensor, rip-off arduino, and a giant plastic container
- Make a dashboard with data from the sensor
    - Wave height predictions (over time)
    - Pressure (in pascals apparently)
    - Max height
    - Alerts for tsunamis over a given threshhold
- Alerting device:
    - Can't be your laptop
    - Needs to be able to alert the whole room
    - No longer than 20s
- Points
    - Dash: 30
    - Alerting: 30
    - Presentation: 20
    - Q&A: 10
    - Code submission: 10
- Awards
    - Best dashboard
    - Best alerting device
    - Science communication
